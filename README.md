> However, permaculture has come to mean more than just food-sufficiency in the household. Self-reliance in food is meaningless unless people have access to land, information, and financial resources. So in recent years it has come to encompass appropriate legal and financial strategies, including strategies for land access, business structures, and regional self-financing.

Problems with existing agricultural robotics
* Proprietary (despite dependence on open source software like Linux, OpenCV, ArduPilot, Python, etc). There are a couple of exceptions such as FarmBot and Twisted Fields
* Designed for monocropping: highly profitable and productive in the short term, but generates negative externalities and unsustainable in a world of [energy descent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqwWdranB5A)
* Inflicts mechanised death to pests and weeds instead of ecosystem symbiosis or whole systems thinking (a [paperclip maximizer](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/paperclip-maximizer) [autonomous weapon system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethal_autonomous_weapon) that kills [Animalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal))
* Thinking of human beings as cost sinks leads to [tendency of the rate of profit to fall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendency_of_the_rate_of_profit_to_fall).

Great quotes from permies about robotic permaculture

> One type robot that already exists, but has not found wide use yet, are hexapods and octopods (ants and spiders).
They can be very energy efficient on rough terrain, remain stable when shut down and can be equipped with big feet to spread their weight.
With an AI, they could be trained to step between plants.

> Now imagine software that helps permaculture designers plan out their development efforts: plant this polyculture here, turn these low-value trees into wood chips there, run this number of chickens over this area, move this dirt to make swales or a pond here, get these off-site inputs of compost and woodchips to kick-start the initial growth, etc. The same software simulates what everything will look like in 2, 5, or 10 years.

> Once finalised, the map can be uploaded to the GPS and laser controlled robotic bulldozers and excavators, which then fire up and begin "permaculturalising" the site while the humans go off for cup of tea. If any of the robots runs into an unexpected obstacle such as shallow granite bedrock or a bottomless sinkhole, it will stop and send an alarm to the consultant who can attend and assess.
